Ok you added you theme, as well but the issue is your style are not working when
the color theme of system is `light` mode, and then if you change your
application to dark it might not work properly.

If you haven't used the theme checkout https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode
for implementing in your application.

The issue arises because the system's color scheme can interfere with the theme
you set in your application. When your system is in light mode, and you change
your application to dark mode, the system's color scheme might override your
styles if you don't explicitly set the color-scheme meta tag. This meta tag
ensures that the browser respects your chosen theme, rather than deferring to
the system's color scheme. Without it, the browser might still apply light mode
styles, even when your application is set to dark mode, leading to
inconsistencies in the appearance.

```tsx
<meta name="color-scheme" content={theme === 'light' ? 'light' : 'dark'} />
```

You explicitly inform the browser which color scheme to use, preventing the
system theme from interfering with your app's theme settings.

```tsx
export async function loader({ request, context }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const { getTheme } = await themeSessionResolver(request);

  return defer({
    theme: getTheme(),
  });
}
```

Now let's implement the app component,

```tsx
export function App() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  const [theme] = useTheme();

  return (
    <html lang="en" className={clsx(theme)}>
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <Meta />
        <Links />
        <PreventFlashOnWrongTheme ssrTheme={Boolean(data.theme)} />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollToTopButton />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

If you do so, it won't work properly, like if you are in the light mode and you
change the theme to dark, your styling will not be working properly. To resolve
this issue you need to use the meta tag of color-scheme.

```tsx
<meta name="color-scheme" content={theme === 'light' ? 'light' : 'dark'} />
```
